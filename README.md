This project was developed as a practical outcome of my Matura studies.

It represents an Android AR game prototype built with Unity and C#, demonstrating gameplay logic and augmented reality interactions.

The project includes a recorded Gameplay demo: [Game Demo Sample.mp4](./Game%20Demo%20Sample.mp4) and documentation in [Project documentation](./dokumentace).
